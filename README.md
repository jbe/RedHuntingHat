**Simple Nimrod test suites**

---

This library is just a quick hack (but one that works for me), that I use to create simple test suites for my Nimrod projects. Right now, it only has one report printer; which produces ANSI colored terminal output.

The report produced by `sample.nim` looks like this:

This library is not in Babel. Download `RedHuntingHat.nim` if you want to use it.
